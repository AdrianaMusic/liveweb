Liveweb Proxy
=============

Liveweb proxy is component of Internet Archive's `wayback machine
project <http://web.archive.org/>`_.

The liveweb proxy captures the content of a web page in real time,
archives it into a ARC or WARC file and returns the ARC/WARC record
back to the wayback machine to process. The recorded ARC/WARC file
becomes part of the wayback machine in due course of time.

.. note::

    The liveweb project is under active development, so this documentation may not be up-to-date.
